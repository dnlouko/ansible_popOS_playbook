My Ansible PopOS! Setup playbook

Welcome to this repository if you also work with ansible and IAC tools feel free to help me build this project.
I'm usin PopOS! as my OS but the playbook can become more flexible by just add the equivalent packages to other Linux Distros.

# Objective
Setup my PopOS! after a clean install with every tool and settings that I'll need.
# Todo
After dismember the tasks convert then into a role
# WIP
Moving settings from the main my_popos_setup.yml playbook to task files to cleanup and organize the code
